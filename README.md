Handler for [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) to support outputting to WP-CLI when running wp command lines.

## Installation
Install the latest version with Composer.

```shell
$ composer require mhcg/monolog-wp-cli
```

## Basic Usage

### Example 1 - Basic Concept

Monolog WP-CLI Handler works the same as any other handler, so create a new WPCLIHandler object and push it to your Logger object.  Of course, this will only work as part of a WP-CLI command within a WordPress theme or plugin.  See Example 2 for a real-world example.

```php
<?php

use Monolog\Logger;
use MHCG\Monolog\Handler\WPCLIHandler;

// create a log channel
$log = new Logger('name');
$log->pushHandler(new WPCLIHandler(Logger::WARNING));

// output to WP-CLI
$log->warning('This is a warning');
$log->error('An error has occurred');
$log->critical('This will report error and exit out');
$log->debug('Only shown when running wp with --debug');
$log->info('General logging - will not be shown when running wp with --quiet');
```

### Example 2 - Basic WordPress Plugin

The following code will create a a new WP-CLI command of `mycommand` that does some logging.

**Note** this code shows basic usage only and is not a recommended or suggested way to create a new command or plugin.  Check out the [WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) GitHub project for a much better way to write plugins.

```shell
composer require mhcg/monolog-wp-cli
```

```php
<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name:     My Plugin
 */

//my-plugin.php

use Monolog\Logger;
use MHCG\Monolog\Handler\WPCLIHandler;

// If this file is called directly, abort.
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
    die;
}

// Autoload
$autoload = dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/vendor/autoload.php';
if ( file_exists( $autoload ) ) {
    require_once $autoload;
}

// 'mycommand' WP-CLI command
if ( defined( 'WP_CLI' ) && WP_CLI ) {

    function mycommand_command( $args ) {
        // create logger
        $log = new Logger( 'name' );
        $log->pushHandler( new WPCLIHandler( Logger::INFO ) );

        // debug -- will only show when wp is run with --debug
        $log->debug( 'Some geeky stuff');

        // the following won't show when wp is run with --quiet
        $log->info( ' Started running' );
        $log->warning( 'Something happened of note' );

        // always shows even with --quiet
        $log->error( 'An error has occurred' );

        // all done - no real equivalent in Logger of WP_CLI::success
        WP_CLI::success( 'Finished running mycommand' );
    }

    WP_CLI::add_command( 'mycommand', 'mycommand_command' );

}
```

```shell
$ wp mycommand
 Started running
Warning: (WARNING) Something happened of note
Error: (ERROR) An error has occurred
Success: Finished running mycommand
```

```shell
$ wp mycommand --quiet
Error: (ERROR) An error has occured
```
